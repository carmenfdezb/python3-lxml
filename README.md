## What is lxml?
The lxml XML toolkit is a Pythonic binding for the C libraries libxml2 and libxslt.
It is unique in that it combines the speed and XML feature completeness of these libraries with the simplicity of a native Python API, mostly compatible but superior to the well-known ElementTree API.The latest release works with all CPython versions from 2.6 to 3.6.

## python3-lxml
I've builded python3-lxml for SailfishOS-i486 because it's needed to install [SailGoal](https://openrepos.net/content/emanymton/sailgoal). Please, use for your own risk
